    "objective": "Open a browser and navigate to mail.google.com. Google will almost certainly block the automated context, so use the 'wait_for_human' tool to perform the entire sign‑in in a separate real browser window. Once authenticated manually, switch back to the VIO browser and have it compose an email to yourself with subject \"VIO Test\" and body \"This is a hard task.\" then send and declare success. Note: even after manual login the agent may see the \"not secure\" warning because the page still detects automation. This scenario is included for experimentation only; for reliable email automation use Google's APIs instead."
